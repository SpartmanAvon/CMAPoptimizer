Under this directory is an example to run MD simulations with the CHARMM36m force field with either CHARMM tip3p water or an example modified alternative water model (see toppar_n010water_ions.str in toppar directory). 

This is used for generating some of the results in the paper (Huang et al, Nat. Methods, 14, 71, 2017).

CHARMM psf and crd files are read, and dcd files are written which can be directly used for analysis with CHARMM.
